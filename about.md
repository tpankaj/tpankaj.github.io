You have reached the blog of Tushar Pankaj, a published researcher in deep learning, enthusiast of systems programming and computer architecture, and hobbyist of 35 mm film-based photography.

I'm a third-year undergraduate student in Computer Science at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. I used to attend the University of California, Berkeley, as an Electrical Engineering and Computer Science student, but transferred to the University of Minnesota for reasons I will eventually detail on this blog.
