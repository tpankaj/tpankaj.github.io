This week, I closed on the first-ever consulting contract for Tarada Consulting, LLC. While I can't currently discuss the client, I can say that I will be working on an interesting machine learning problem as a consultant.

I'm hoping that Tarada Consulting will continue to win consulting contracts and allow me to gain more experience in machine learning. There are also some potential opportunities for collaboration with researchers in different fields for application of machine learning to areas where it's never been applied before.

Once this contract is complete, if I receive permission to publish my client's name, then I'll put up an update at that time.
