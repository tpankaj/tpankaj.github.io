I haven't updated this blog in a long time. I'm still doing machine learning in my professional career (i.e. internships) but I haven't been doing much research after leaving Berkeley Deep Drive. As a result, I'll probably talk more about the rest of my life here rather than just deep learning. In this instance, I'll post my Instant Pot recipe for masala khichdi. My aunt was joking that if I get an Instant Pot, I'll end up having a YouTube channel like [Instapottin' With Poonam][poonam] called Instapottin' with Tushar. I plan to do no such thing, but since my masala khichdi turned out well, I might as well post my recipe:

1. 3 tablespoons ghee
2. 1 teaspoon curry powder
3. 1 teaspoon garam masala
4. 1 teaspoon onion powder
5. Press saute and wait for ghee to heat
6. 1 1/2 teaspoon jeera
7. Wait until jeera starts to pop
8. 1 cup brown rice washed
9. 1 cup daal washed
10. 1/4 cup canned diced tomatoes
11. 3 cups frozen mixed veggies
12. 1 tablespoon salt
13. 6 cups water
14. Stir well
15. Press cancel
16. Pressure cook for 15 minutes
17. Natural pressure release for 10 minutes
