Today, I am starting a blog to keep track of my deep learning research. I'm an undergraduate research assistant at the [Berkeley DeepDrive][bdd] lab. I work under Dr. Karl Zipser on the [Automous Driving in Unstructured Conditions][bdd-karl] project. I've been on this project since January 2017, and I just finished up a summer internship at Qualcomm before returning back to the Berkeley DeepDrive project.

My research interests on this project are on studying the use of [SqueezeNet][squeezenet] as an autonomous driving-capable neural network. This includes comparing it to our existing network that was designed by Karl, as well as trying to build upon the SqueezeNet network to achieve higher performance on our validation dataset.

My goal is to update this blog at least once a week with my latest research work and deep learning experience, and to use it as an engineering notebook to refer back to.
